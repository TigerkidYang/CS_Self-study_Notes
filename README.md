# CS_Self-study_Notes

## Introduction

I want to write some notes during the procedure of my cs self-studying. Basically about Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Computer Networking, and Operating System. Maybe some more stuffs that I would be studying in the future.

I only write these notes to make sure I understand the stuffs and its logic. I think the original materials of those courses that I listed below in the front of every section will be more helpful for you than my notes. 

## Plans and Current Status

2025.4.1: Decided to start this repo and have not written anything but part of contents.

2025.4.5: Actually started to write. I think update here is stupid. Go for the [Log](#log) for details.

## Contents

### JAVA

I learn the basic from [UCB CS61B Spring 2021](https://sp21.datastructur.es/index.html) and other stuffs myself.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (JAVA)

I learn this from [UCB CS61B Spring 2021](https://sp21.datastructur.es/index.html) and [MIT 6.006 Fall 2011](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) + [6.046 Spring 2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/).

### Computer Architecture (C)

I learn this from [UCB CS61C Fall 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0j-r-omG7i0-mnsxN5T4UcVS1Di0isqf).

(and so on.)

### Computer Networking

I learn this from the book Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach and the [official teaching videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1ya5dD_M8uX-BLUF1FEvUNsYWQL5_l0O) from the author in UMASS.

### Operating System

I learn this from [MIT 6.S081 Fall 2020](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html).

## Log

2025.4.5: Write half of the [LinkedLists](./Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/LinkedLists.md), til the part before SLList.

2025.4.8: Have the [LinkedLists](./Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/LinkedLists.md) done.
